This project is an online platform for purchasing tickets and booking seats for various events, such as concerts, theater performances, sporting events, and movie screenings. Users can select events, view interactive seating plans, and pay for tickets online.

## Key Features

Buying tickets – the ability to select an event, ticket categories and make a purchase with the receipt of an electronic ticket (QR code, PDF, SMS).

Booking seats – an interactive map of the hall with a choice of seats, various price categories and logic for preventing single empty seats.

Event catalog – filtering events by category, date, price and location, as well as the ability to subscribe to organizers.
